## Solution

**SWP-COVID19** is India’s peer-to-peer resource sharing platform. It was started in April 2020 during the on-set of the COVID-19 
lockdown in India. It brings the concept of helping your neighbour at a time of need – to a virtual space. Users can connect with 
others in their community by placing requests for essential resources.
This way, **SWP-COVID19** has created a unique networking space to connect community ‘superheroes’ with opportunities to make a 
difference.
Beyond essential resources, the platform also aims to help people build each other by giving users a space to list services they
would like to provide to their community
